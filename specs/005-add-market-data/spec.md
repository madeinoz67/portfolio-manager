# Feature Specification: Market Data Provider Adapters

**Feature Branch**: `005-add-market-data`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add market data provider adapters, need to standardize the way data providers can be added so want to look at adapter pattern, adapters to provide a common interface, will return costs, max calls, metrics like letency, if the underlying provider doesnt provde then the adapter will.  adapters are to be extensible as currently they get stock price data, howver may have other abilities like new, etc.  will only support price data. the admin market data dashboard to be updated with the new adapter and metrics.  need to amke sure no hard coded metrics or data, all is to be live and dynamic"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need to manage and monitor multiple market data providers through a standardized interface so that I can easily add new providers, track their performance metrics, and ensure consistent data delivery across the portfolio management system without being locked into specific vendor implementations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new market data provider needs to be added, **When** an admin configures the provider through the standardized adapter interface, **Then** the system can fetch stock prices and track provider metrics without code changes
2. **Given** multiple market data providers are configured, **When** an admin views the market data dashboard, **Then** they see live metrics for all providers including latency, success rates, costs, and rate limits
3. **Given** a provider experiences high latency, **When** the admin views provider metrics, **Then** they can identify performance issues and switch to alternative providers if needed
4. **Given** the system is fetching stock prices, **When** a provider fails or hits rate limits, **Then** the adapter reports accurate metrics and the system can gracefully handle the failure

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a provider doesn't supply certain metrics (latency, cost data)?
- How does the system handle providers with different rate limiting schemes?
- What occurs when all configured providers are unavailable?
- How are provider configuration changes handled during active trading hours?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a standardized adapter interface for integrating market data providers
- **FR-002**: System MUST support multiple market data providers simultaneously through the adapter pattern
- **FR-003**: Adapters MUST track and report provider metrics including latency, success rates, and error counts
- **FR-004**: Adapters MUST track cost information per provider when available from the underlying service
- **FR-005**: Adapters MUST report maximum call limits and current usage for each provider
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide default metric tracking when underlying providers don't supply specific metrics
- **FR-007**: Admin dashboard MUST display live, dynamic metrics for all configured providers
- **FR-008**: System MUST support extensible adapter capabilities beyond basic stock price data
- **FR-009**: Initial implementation MUST focus only on stock price data retrieval
- **FR-010**: All provider metrics and data MUST be live and dynamic, with no hard-coded values
- **FR-011**: Adapters MUST handle provider-specific error conditions and rate limiting gracefully
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow adding new providers without requiring system restarts or code deployment

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Market Data Adapter**: Standardized interface wrapper around external market data providers, tracking metrics and providing consistent data access
- **Provider Configuration**: Settings and credentials for each market data provider, including rate limits and cost parameters
- **Provider Metrics**: Real-time performance data including latency, success rates, error counts, and usage statistics
- **Cost Tracking**: Records of API usage costs and limits per provider for budget management
- **Adapter Registry**: Central registry of available adapters and their capabilities for dynamic provider management
