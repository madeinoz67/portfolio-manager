# Research: Market Data Provider Adapters

## Overview
Research findings for implementing a standardized adapter pattern for market data providers with unified metrics tracking, cost monitoring, and extensible architecture.

## Decision 1: Core Architecture Pattern

**Decision**: Abstract Base Class + Registry Pattern + Factory
**Rationale**:
- ABC enforces implementation contracts and provides common functionality through mixins
- Registry pattern with decorators enables clean, automatic provider registration
- Factory pattern enables dynamic provider instantiation from configuration
- Supports hot-swapping providers without application restart

**Alternatives considered**:
- Protocol-based interfaces: Less enforcement of contracts
- Manual registry management: More error-prone, requires explicit registration calls
- Direct class instantiation: No dynamic configuration support

## Decision 2: Dynamic Provider Registry

**Decision**: Use class-registry library with decorator-based registration
**Rationale**:
- Automatic provider discovery and registration
- Clean decorator syntax for provider registration
- Thread-safe registry implementation
- Supports plugin architecture for external providers

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual dictionary registry: More maintenance overhead
- Entry points only: Less flexible for internal providers
- Import-based discovery: Fragile and requires specific module structure

## Decision 3: Configuration Management

**Decision**: dependency-injector framework with YAML configuration
**Rationale**:
- Professional-grade dependency injection with hot-reloading
- Excellent configuration management with environment variable support
- Type-safe configuration with validation
- Supports multiple provider configurations simultaneously

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pydantic Settings: Limited DI capabilities
- Environment variables only: Not suitable for complex multi-provider configs
- JSON configuration: Less readable, no comments support

## Decision 4: Metrics Collection

**Decision**: aioprometheus for asyncio-compatible Prometheus metrics
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard metrics format with rich querying capabilities
- Excellent FastAPI integration for /metrics endpoint
- Asyncio-native for performance in async applications
- Rich metric types (Counter, Histogram, Gauge) for comprehensive tracking

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom metrics storage: Reinventing the wheel, no standard tooling
- StatsD: Less feature-rich than Prometheus
- OpenTelemetry: Overkill for current requirements, more complex setup

## Decision 5: Resilience Patterns

**Decision**: Separate libraries - tenacity for retries, pybreaker for circuit breaking
**Rationale**:
- Each library specializes in its domain with proven implementations
- tenacity provides sophisticated retry strategies (exponential backoff, jitter)
- pybreaker offers mature circuit breaker implementation
- Better configurability and observability than custom implementations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single resilience library: Limited feature set in available options
- Custom implementation: High maintenance cost, bug-prone
- No resilience patterns: Poor user experience during provider failures

## Decision 6: Provider Implementation Pattern

**Decision**: Mixin pattern for cross-cutting concerns (resilience, metrics, logging)
**Rationale**:
- Promotes composition over inheritance
- Reusable across all provider implementations
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual aspects in isolation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Inheritance hierarchy: Less flexible, harder to test
- Decorator pattern only: More complex for stateful concerns
- Aspect-oriented programming: Adds complexity without clear benefits

## Decision 7: HTTP Client Management

**Decision**: aiohttp with session reuse and context managers
**Rationale**:
- High-performance async HTTP client
- Connection pooling and keep-alive support
- Excellent timeout and error handling
- Context managers ensure proper resource cleanup

**Alternatives considered**:
- httpx: Similar features but less mature ecosystem
- requests with thread pools: Worse performance, more complex
- urllib: Too low-level, missing modern features

## Decision 8: Configuration File Format

**Decision**: YAML with environment variable interpolation
**Rationale**:
- Human-readable with comments support
- Excellent Python ecosystem support
- Environment variable substitution for secrets
- Hierarchical structure matches multi-provider configuration needs

**Alternatives considered**:
- JSON: No comments, less readable for complex configs
- TOML: Less familiar to ops teams
- Python files: Security risk, not suitable for runtime modification

## Decision 9: Plugin Architecture

**Decision**: Entry points with automatic discovery using pkg_resources
**Rationale**:
- Standard Python packaging mechanism for plugins
- Automatic discovery without hardcoded imports
- Supports third-party provider packages
- Graceful handling of plugin loading failures

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual plugin loading: Requires explicit configuration
- Import hooks: More complex, harder to debug
- File-based plugins: Security concerns, path management issues

## Decision 10: Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Graceful degradation with fallback provider chains
**Rationale**:
- Maintains service availability during provider outages
- Configurable fallback ordering based on provider reliability
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- User-transparent failover for better experience

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fail-fast approach: Poor user experience during outages
- Single provider only: No redundancy
- Load balancing: More complex, doesn't handle complete provider failures

## Implementation Libraries

### Core Dependencies
- `dependency-injector`: Dependency injection and configuration management
- `class-registry`: Dynamic provider registry with decorator support
- `pydantic`: Data validation and settings management
- `aioprometheus`: Async Prometheus metrics collection

### Resilience and HTTP
- `aiohttp`: High-performance async HTTP client
- `tenacity`: Sophisticated retry mechanisms with backoff strategies

## Database Schema Requirements

### New Tables Required
1. **adapter_configurations**: Provider settings and credentials
2. **adapter_metrics**: Real-time performance metrics
3. **adapter_cost_tracking**: Usage cost monitoring
4. **adapter_registry**: Active adapter registration

### Alembic Migration Considerations
- All new tables, no existing data migration required
- Foreign key relationships to existing user/admin tables
- Indexes on frequently queried metric fields
- Partitioning strategy for high-volume metrics data

## Security Considerations

1. **Credential Management**: Store API keys encrypted at rest
2. **Admin Access**: Reuse existing JWT + role-based authentication
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-provider rate limiting
4. **Audit Logging**: Track adapter configuration changes
5. **Input Validation**: Strict validation of provider configurations

## Performance Targets

1. **API Response Time**: <200ms for adapter management endpoints
2. **Metrics Collection**: <10ms overhead per provider request
3. **Throughput**: Support 1000+ requests/second across all adapters
4. **Memory Usage**: <100MB additional memory per active adapter
5. **Storage**: Efficient metrics storage with automatic cleanup

## Integration Points

1. **Existing Market Data Service**: Adapters integrate as new data sources
2. **Admin Dashboard**: New adapter management UI components
3. **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics endpoint at `/api/v1/metrics`
4. **Configuration**: Hot-reloading without service restart
5. **Audit System**: Integration with existing audit logging

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Provider Failures**: Circuit breaker and fallback chains
2. **Rate Limiting**: Per-provider quota management
3. **Cost Control**: Real-time cost tracking with alerts
4. **Configuration Errors**: Validation before activation
5. **Performance Impact**: Async implementation with connection pooling
