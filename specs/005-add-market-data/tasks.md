# Tasks: Market Data Provider Adapters

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-add-market-data/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Parallel Example
```
# Phase 3.2: Launch contract tests together after setup complete
Task: "Contract test GET /api/v1/admin/adapters in backend/tests/contract/test_admin_adapters_list.py"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/v1/admin/adapters in backend/tests/contract/test_admin_adapters_create.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/v1/admin/adapters/{id} in backend/tests/contract/test_admin_adapters_get.py"
Task: "Contract test PUT /api/v1/admin/adapters/{id} in backend/tests/contract/test_admin_adapters_update.py"
Task: "Contract test DELETE /api/v1/admin/adapters/{id} in backend/tests/contract/test_admin_adapters_delete.py"

# Phase 3.3: Launch model creation together after tests written
Task: "ProviderConfiguration model in backend/src/models/provider_configuration.py"
Task: "ProviderMetrics model in backend/src/models/provider_metrics.py"
Task: "CostTrackingRecord model in backend/src/models/cost_tracking_record.py"
Task: "AdapterRegistry model in backend/src/models/adapter_registry.py"
Task: "AdapterHealthCheck model in backend/src/models/adapter_health_check.py"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task completion
- Follow TDD: Red-Green-Refactor cycle mandatory
- All credentials must be encrypted at rest
- Metrics must be live/dynamic - no hard-coded values
- Use decimal precision for all cost calculations

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each endpoint → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Migration → single migration task after models

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each scenario → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart validation → final verification task

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration → Frontend → Polish
   - TDD mandated: All tests before any implementation

## Validation Checklist
