# Feature Specification: Admin Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `003-admin-dashboard`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "admin dashboard only viewable by admin role"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need a centralized dashboard to monitor and manage the portfolio management system, including user accounts, system health, and overall platform usage, so that I can ensure smooth operation and quickly address any issues.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an authenticated user with admin role, **When** I access the admin dashboard, **Then** I should see an overview of system metrics including total users, portfolios, and recent activity
2. **Given** I am a regular user without admin role, **When** I attempt to access the admin dashboard, **Then** I should be denied access with appropriate error message
3. **Given** I am viewing the admin dashboard, **When** I navigate to user management, **Then** I should be able to view, search, and manage user accounts
4. **Given** I am in user management, **When** I select a specific user, **Then** I should see a user detail page displaying their admin status and other relevant information
5. **Given** I am an admin user, **When** I need to investigate system issues, **Then** I should have access to system logs and health monitoring information
6. **Given** I am managing the system, **When** I need to perform administrative actions, **Then** I should be able to suspend users, reset passwords, and manage system settings
7. **Given** I am monitoring platform usage, **When** I view analytics, **Then** I should see metrics about portfolio performance, user engagement, and system resource usage
8. **Given** I am managing external data feeds, **When** I access data feed management, **Then** I should be able to disable feeds, adjust update schedules, and view usage statistics and API costs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user with admin role tries to perform actions on their own account?
- How does the system handle users who lose admin role while actively using the dashboard?
- What happens when a data feed is disabled while portfolio calculations are in progress?
- How are API cost limits and alerts handled for external data providers?
- How does the system handle admin access during system maintenance or outages?
- What safeguards prevent accidental deletion of critical user data?
- How are admin actions logged and audited for compliance?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST restrict admin dashboard access exclusively to users with admin role, denying access to all regular users
- **FR-002**: System MUST display real-time system metrics including active users, total portfolios, and system health status
- **FR-003**: Administrators MUST be able to view, search, and filter user accounts with key information like registration date, last login, and portfolio count
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide a user detail page that displays admin status and comprehensive user information when an administrator selects a specific user
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide user management capabilities including account suspension, password reset, and profile modification
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain audit logs of all administrative actions with timestamps and admin user identification
- **FR-006**: Administrators MUST be able to view portfolio analytics including total assets under management, performance metrics, and usage statistics
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide system health monitoring including database status, market data feed status, and error rates
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide external data feed management capabilities including enable/disable controls, schedule adjustment, and usage statistics
- **FR-015**: System MUST display API usage statistics and costs for each external data provider with historical tracking
- **FR-016**: Administrators MUST be able to modify data feed update schedules and enable/disable individual providers
- **FR-008**: System MUST verify admin role for existing authenticated users before granting dashboard access
- **FR-011**: System MUST restrict admin actions to users with admin role only, using a single admin role without hierarchical permissions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Admin User**: Represents system administrators with elevated privileges, including authentication credentials, permission level, and activity tracking
- **System Metrics**: Aggregated data about platform usage, performance indicators, and health status for monitoring purposes
- **Audit Log Entry**: Records of administrative actions including timestamp, admin user, action type, affected resources, and outcome
- **User Management Record**: Administrative view of user accounts with enhanced details for management purposes including account status and administrative notes
- **Data Feed Configuration**: Settings and status for external data providers including schedule, enabled status, cost tracking, and usage metrics
