# Feature Specification: Real-Time Market Data Integration

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-real-time`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add real-time market data integration with WebSocket streaming for live portfolio value updates"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: real-time data, WebSocket streaming, portfolio value updates, market data
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Market data source specified: Yahoo Finance free API initially
   ‚Üí Update frequency not defined [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: view portfolio with live value updates
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements for update frequency
6. Identify Key Entities (market data, price updates, portfolios)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - update frequency unclear
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after update frequency clarification)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an investor, I want to see my portfolio values update in real-time as market prices change, so that I can make timely investment decisions and track my performance without manually refreshing the page.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a portfolio with stock holdings, **When** market prices change during trading hours, **Then** my portfolio total value should update automatically within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable delay - seconds? minutes?]
2. **Given** I am viewing my portfolio dashboard, **When** a stock price increases, **Then** I should see the updated holding value and total portfolio value reflect the change
3. **Given** multiple users are viewing the same stock, **When** the market price updates, **Then** all users should receive the same price update simultaneously
4. **Given** the market data connection is lost, **When** I am viewing my portfolio, **Then** I should see a clear indicator that prices may be stale and when the last update occurred

### Administrative Control Scenarios
5. **Given** I am an administrator, **When** I access the admin panel, **Then** I should be able to view and modify global market data poll intervals for all users
6. **Given** I am an administrator, **When** I need to manage API costs, **Then** I should be able to set custom poll intervals for specific users or portfolios
7. **Given** I am an administrator, **When** I view the API usage dashboard, **Then** I should see real-time tracking of external API requests, remaining quotas, and estimated costs
8. **Given** I am an administrator, **When** I need to investigate high API usage, **Then** I should be able to generate reports showing consumption by user, portfolio, and time period
9. **Given** I am an administrator, **When** maintenance is required, **Then** I should be able to temporarily disable market data updates for specific users or globally

### Edge Cases
- What happens when market data feed is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle rapid price fluctuations during high volatility periods?
- What occurs when a user's device goes offline and reconnects?
- How are updates handled when markets are closed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display real-time portfolio values that update automatically when underlying stock prices change
- **FR-002**: System MUST show the last update timestamp for each price to indicate data freshness  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to see individual holding values update in real-time along with total portfolio value
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle connection interruptions gracefully and automatically reconnect when possible
- **FR-005**: System MUST indicate connection status (connected, disconnected, reconnecting) to users
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide price updates for Australian markets (ASX) initially, with support for additional markets through extensible provider interface
- **FR-007**: System MUST update prices with frequency of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: update interval not specified - every second, 15 seconds, minute?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST source market data from Yahoo Finance free API initially, with extensible architecture to support additional providers (Bloomberg, IEX, etc.) in future
- **FR-009**: System MUST continue to function when real-time data is unavailable by showing last known prices with staleness indicators
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle reasonable concurrent user load for initial deployment (target: 1-2 simultaneous users initially)
- **FR-011**: Administrators MUST be able to configure and modify global poll intervals for market data updates affecting all users
- **FR-012**: Administrators MUST be able to set custom poll intervals for individual users or portfolios to manage API usage
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide administrators with real-time tracking of external API usage including request counts, rate limits, and costs
- **FR-014**: Administrators MUST have access to comprehensive reporting on market data API consumption by user, portfolio, and time period
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow administrators to temporarily disable market data updates for specific users or globally during maintenance
- **FR-016**: Administrative controls for market data management MUST only be accessible to users with administrator role through a dedicated admin dashboard/menu

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Market Price Update**: Real-time price change event containing stock symbol, new price, timestamp, and volume data from Yahoo Finance API
- **Data Provider**: Abstraction layer allowing multiple market data sources (Yahoo Finance initially, extensible for Bloomberg, IEX, etc.)
- **Price History**: Historical record of price changes for analytical and backup purposes when real-time feed fails
- **Connection Status**: Current state of real-time data connection (active, disconnected, error, reconnecting)
- **Portfolio Valuation**: Calculated total value of portfolio holdings based on current market prices
- **Poll Interval Configuration**: Administrative settings that control how frequently market data is fetched for users, portfolios, or globally
- **API Usage Metrics**: Real-time tracking data including request counts, rate limits, costs, and consumption patterns by user and time period
- **Administrative Override**: Temporary settings that allow administrators to disable or modify market data updates for maintenance or cost control
