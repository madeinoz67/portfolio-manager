-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a portfolio manager, I want to toggle between tile view and table view of my portfolios so I can choose the display format that best suits my analysis needs - cards for visual overview or table for detailed comparison.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have multiple portfolios, **When** I navigate to the portfolio list, **Then** I see all my portfolios in tile view (default) with a toggle control visible
2. **Given** I'm viewing portfolios in tile view, **When** I click the "Table" toggle button, **Then** the view switches to table layout showing the same portfolio information
3. **Given** I'm viewing portfolios in table view, **When** I click the "Tiles" toggle button, **Then** the view switches back to card layout
4. **Given** I set my preferred view mode, **When** I refresh the page or return later, **Then** my view preference is remembered
5. **Given** I'm in either view mode, **When** I click on a portfolio, **Then** I'm taken to that portfolio's detailed view
6. **Given** I have no portfolios created, **When** I view the portfolio list, **Then** I see a helpful message encouraging me to create my first portfolio in both view modes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when portfolio data is temporarily unavailable (market data service down)?
- How does the system handle portfolios with stale price data (>30 minutes old)?
- What appears for empty portfolios (no holdings)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all portfolios belonging to the authenticated user
- **FR-002**: System MUST show current total value for each portfolio
