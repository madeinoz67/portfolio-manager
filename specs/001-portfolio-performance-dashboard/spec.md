## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As an investor managing multiple share portfolios with collaborative access, I need a secure intelligent portfolio management system with user authentication and permission management that uses extensible agentic workflows powered by configurable AI providers (internal like Ollama or external like OpenAI) to automatically track my transactions from broker emails, monitor dividend payments, update daily closing prices, discover and archive relevant news articles, analyze stock data to provide buy/sell/hold recommendations, perform portfolio-level analysis for rebalancing and risk management, and provide comprehensive performance dashboards with annual financial reporting and API access, so I can have my portfolios automatically maintained with complete income and capital gains data plus AI-powered investment insights and portfolio optimization recommendations for informed decision-making while allowing trusted users to collaborate on portfolio management.

11. **Given** I receive dividend payments, **When** the system detects dividend notifications, **Then** it automatically records the dividend income against the relevant stock and portfolio
12. **Given** I want to view my annual performance, **When** I access the financial year report, **Then** I see total income from dividends, capital gains/losses, and overall portfolio performance for tax reporting
13. **Given** relevant news exists for my portfolio stocks, **When** the daily price update runs, **Then** the system discovers, downloads, and archives news articles in paperless-ngx with intelligent tagging
14. **Given** I view a specific stock in the UI, **When** I access its details, **Then** I can see linked news articles and documents from paperless-ngx related to that stock
15. **Given** I access the portfolio dashboard from any device, **When** I view the interface, **Then** I see a clean, modern design that adapts responsively to my screen size
16. **Given** I interact with charts and data visualizations, **When** I hover, click, or scroll, **Then** the interface responds dynamically with smooth animations and real-time updates

26. **Given** I have configured my rebalancing parameters, **When** the system performs portfolio analysis, **Then** it uses my custom settings to generate personalized rebalancing recommendations
27. **Given** I am a portfolio owner, **When** I want to share access with other users, **Then** I can invite users and assign them specific permission levels (view-only, edit, or admin) for my portfolio
28. **Given** I have been granted access to a shared portfolio, **When** I log in, **Then** I can view and interact with the portfolio according to my assigned permission level

32. **Given** AI systems are generating analysis or recommendations, **When** the system detects potential hallucinations or false data, **Then** it implements validation checks and flags questionable results for human review
33. **Given** I am an administrator or auditor, **When** I need to review system activity, **Then** I can access comprehensive logs and audit trails showing all user actions, system processes, and data modifications
34. **Given** a security incident or compliance review occurs, **When** investigators examine the audit trail, **Then** they can trace all actions back to specific users, timestamps, and system components with complete accountability

39. **Given** a remote service (price data, AI provider, news source) times out, **When** the system detects the timeout, **Then** it implements exponential backoff retry mechanisms before failing gracefully
40. **Given** a broker email cannot be parsed automatically, **When** the parsing fails, **Then** the system flags the email for human intervention and notifies the user for manual review and processing
41. **Given** a PDF document (statements, trade confirmations, reports) cannot be parsed automatically, **When** the parsing fails, **Then** the system flags the document for human intervention and provides tools for manual data extraction
42. **Given** duplicate transactions are detected from multiple sources, **When** the system processes them, **Then** it resolves duplicates using the latest timestamp and maintains a complete history of all received transactions for human review
43. **Given** a workflow is processing data (transactions, analysis, updates), **When** any step in the workflow fails, **Then** the system prevents partial data commits, rolls back to the previous consistent state, and alerts humans of the failure for intervention
