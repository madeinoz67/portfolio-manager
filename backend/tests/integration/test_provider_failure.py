"""
Integration test for provider failure handling.

Tests the complete user scenario:
1. Adapter configured and working normally
2. Provider experiences failures (network, rate limit, service down)
3. Circuit breaker activates
4. Admin is notified of failures
5. System recovers when provider is back online

Based on Scenario 3 from quickstart.md
