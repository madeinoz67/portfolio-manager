Integration test for cost monitoring and alerting functionality.

Tests the complete user scenario:
1. Providers configured with cost tracking enabled
2. API calls generate cost records
3. Cost thresholds and budgets are monitored
4. Admin receives alerts when approaching limits
5. Cost reports are available for analysis

Based on Scenario 5 from quickstart.md
