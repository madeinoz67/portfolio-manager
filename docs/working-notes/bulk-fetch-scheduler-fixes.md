# Working Notes - Bulk Fetch and Scheduler Fixes

## ✅ TASK COMPLETE: Data Provider Symbol Batching Issues Fixed

**Status**: COMPLETED - Both bulk fetch variable scope and scheduler symbol selection issues resolved

**Date**: 2025-09-17

### Issue Summary
The data provider symbol batching system had two critical issues:
1. Variable scope bug in bulk fetch logic causing potential failures
2. Scheduler only processing portfolio holdings, leaving other symbols stale

### Fixed Issues

#### 1. ✅ Bulk Fetch Variable Scope Fix
**Problem**: `UnboundLocalError` potential in `fetch_multiple_prices()` method
- **Root Cause**: `bulk_results` variable only defined within conditional branches but used outside them
- **Symptom**: Bulk operations could fail if conditions weren't met properly
- **Files**: `backend/src/services/market_data_service.py:234`

**Solution**: Added proper variable initialization
```python
# Initialize bulk_results
bulk_results = {}

# Determine which bulk method to use
if provider.name == "yfinance":
    bulk_results = await self._bulk_fetch_from_yfinance(remaining_symbols)
```

**Result**: Bulk fetching now works reliably for multiple symbols with proper error handling

#### 2. ✅ Scheduler Symbol Selection Fix
**Problem**: Only 2-3 symbols updated instead of all actively monitored symbols
- **Root Cause**: Scheduler used portfolio holdings query instead of `get_actively_monitored_symbols()`
- **Symptom**: Extra symbols (not in portfolios) showed as "stale" in admin UI
- **Files**: `backend/src/services/scheduler_service.py`

**Solution**: Replaced portfolio-only query with actively monitored symbols
```python
# OLD: Only portfolio holdings
unique_symbols = (
    self.db.query(Stock.symbol)
    .join(Holding, Stock.id == Holding.stock_id)
    .distinct()
    .all()
)

# NEW: Actively monitored symbols (portfolio + recent requests)
market_service = MarketDataService(self.db)
symbols_to_fetch = market_service.get_actively_monitored_symbols(
    provider_bulk_limit=50,  # Allow more symbols for bulk operations
    minutes_lookback=60      # Consider symbols requested in last hour
)
```

**Result**: Now processes all 9 actively monitored symbols with 100% success rate

### Testing Results

#### Before Fix
- Portfolio holdings: 2 symbols (FE, CSL)
- Activity logs: "3 symbols updated" (from old broken logic)
- Stale symbols: 7 symbols showing as outdated

#### After Fix
- Actively monitored: 9 symbols (ANZ, BHP, CBA, CSL, FE, NAB, TLS, WBC, WOW)
- Activity logs: "9 symbols updated" with bulk operations
- Success rate: 100% (9/9 symbols processed)

### Technical Details

#### Bulk Operations Working Correctly
The system now:
1. **Identifies bulk capability**: Checks if provider supports bulk operations
2. **Batch processes symbols**: Uses `_bulk_fetch_from_yfinance()` for efficiency
3. **Single API call**: Fetches all symbols in one request instead of 9 individual calls
4. **Proper logging**: Activity logs show "Bulk fetch from yfinance: 9 symbols updated"

#### Symbol Selection Strategy
The `get_actively_monitored_symbols()` method includes:
1. **Portfolio holdings**: Symbols currently held in active portfolios (FE, CSL)
2. **Recent requests**: Symbols requested via API in last 60 minutes (ANZ, BHP, CBA, etc.)
3. **Smart filtering**: Removes duplicates and limits based on provider bulk capacity

### Performance Improvements
- **Reduced API calls**: 1 bulk call instead of 9 individual calls (9x efficiency gain)
- **Eliminated staleness**: All monitored symbols stay fresh
- **Better resource usage**: Respects rate limits while maintaining comprehensive coverage

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Activity logs**: Bulk operations properly logged with symbol counts
- **Success tracking**: 100% success rate monitored in admin dashboard
- **Automatic scheduling**: 15-minute intervals maintain fresh data for all symbols
- **Graceful fallback**: Individual fetches used if bulk operations fail

### Related Components
This fix enhances the existing market data architecture:
- **Single master table**: `realtime_symbols` remains single source of truth
- **Bulk optimization**: Leverages existing `_bulk_fetch_from_yfinance()` method
- **Activity logging**: Integrates with provider activity tracking
- **Admin dashboard**: Shows accurate bulk operation metrics

### Future Considerations
- **Additional providers**: Alpha Vantage bulk operations also supported
- **Scaling**: Can handle more symbols by adjusting `provider_bulk_limit`
- **Monitoring**: Activity logs provide insight into performance trends
- **Rate limiting**: System respects provider limits while maximizing efficiency
